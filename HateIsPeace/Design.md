# Hate is Peace: Open Design Docs
Hate is Peace is a first-person shooter sandbox game using Amnesia: The Dark Descent's engine. While the engine may be very unusual to work with for a first-person shooter game, I believe that it should be more appropriate and fit for the long run, as it has easy-to-use developer tools for modders and some documentation. Maybe it could be, who knows

# Characters
## Main
### Roozer
This is the main self-insert of Hate is Peace. Roozer is a powerless but brave young man, with blue hair and a suit. Usually, he is pretty introverted and no one really talks to him except Sarven and his friend Alice. He is around 5 feet and 4 inches tall, or 163 centimeters

### Sarven
A tall but wonderful demon with the heart of an angel, Sarven is Roozer's significant other. She can be used as a companion in single-player missions, to revive after dying, or to blow some steam off in the bedroom. She is around 7 feet and 3 inches tall, or 220 centimeters

### Alice
Alice is a weapons merchant and runs a store in the town, where she can be used to buy, sell and repair items, along with armor from Roozer's inventory. She is around 5 feet and 2 inches tall, or 157 centimeters

## Bosses
### Simon
What used to be Willow's iMessage fuckboy and femboy, Simon has now turned into a cheap bootleg knockoff of Davoth from DOOM Eternal :) Apparently, this boy is skinny weak and loves to wear maid outfits, while also busting to Chongyun x Xingqiu ships (I'll just call it Wang x Wong, simply because all these Chinese names are so God damn hard to pronounce for American tongues)

Sarven and Roozer both hate this guy because of all the damage that he had done to Roozer, so they have all the right reasons to break his bones and kill him. Thankfully he is pretty weak, so it shouldn't be too much of a big deal showing the chinks in his armor by simply shooting him with a pea shooter. Which is obviously very funny, and makes Roozer and Sarven die laughing together whenever they attempt to destroy his "armor"

### Sassy Sissies Stella and Zaynah
Stella and Zay are twins who both seem to be older than Roozer. Unfortunately, they are far less mature for their age, get way too distracted on their phones, watch too much TikTok, listen to too much K-pop, wear too much makeup which makes them look very artificial, and speak British tongue (they might have broken teeth anyway since they speak in that accent). Apparently, they're like Panty and Stocking but much worse

### Natasha
Obviously I don't have a better description for this bitch, so I guess I'll say that she's the type of person that would fit more in a psych ward than spending her life walking around in Mexico all for nothing. Oh, and she gets mentally insane over small shit and then blames it on someone else, when she clearly DID something herself. Like, I guess back in 2021 she used to make threats about killing herself after Roozer accidentally interrupted Willow... THE ABSOLUTELY FUNNY THING IS THAT IT WAS JUST A SMALL THING. AND SHE LITERALLY OVERREACTED TO SOMETHING THIS SMALL, SMALLER LIKE A DAMN STRAND OF HAIR ðŸ¤£ god I can't stand Generation Z people anymore after saying that

Anyway... yeah i dont know what to say about her, other than she's really insane. Like simon, she can be shot by a pea shooter but she's also somewhat stronger than him. Still doesn't make her invulnerable to high-damage attacks though

### Mecha-Maily + Jonathan Vaghaun
A creation from the mind of a madman, Mecha-Maily/Mailman is a machine and a monster at the same time. Originally, he used to be tortured a lot by Willow simply because he was being a dumb freak and a wimp. Now with Mr. Vaghaun's efforts, he has been turned into a slaughter machine. Willow has feared this creation ever since, and never came back to pester Maily ever again

Maily is equipped with a rocket launcher, a laser and a machine gun on his arms. Part of his face are missing meat and eyes, so part of it shows his skull in the inside

## Miscellany
### Willow
A quiet and dormant but open-minded old friend of Roozer, Willow is Sarven's biggest fear. Even though she has never hurt anyone or doesn't mean to give out any bad intentions at all, Sarven can be easily scared and will immediately run away by her appearance

There's a reason why Sarven could run away from Willow... Actually, three reasons: Firstly, for some reason she can sometimes come off as intimidating especially whenever she is around. Secondly, she can also sometimes go feral if things ever piss her off or make her angry. Lastly, it's usually recommended that people don't mess with her. Whatever they do, she means very serious business, and she really means it

# Creation
These are the tools I use to craft Hate is Peace. All of them can be obtained by downloading, buying or pirating them if you're devious enough

## Code
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) - for editing HPS/Lang/txt/etc. files
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) - for pushing code and commits
- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) - for editing the source code lol

## Graphics
- [Paint.net](https://getpaint.net/) - for creating, editing and saving textures/sprites

## Models
- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) - this tool is mainly for sculpting meshes. All models must be exported to the OBJ file format
- Maya 2011 - This tool is for importing and rigging meshes which can be ready to use for the game. Legitimate copies of this specific version of Maya are incredibly hard to find, so I just use a cracked version anyway. Sorry and Thanks Autodesk :(

I use a plugin for Maya 2011 called OpenCOLLADA which can export models using the appropriate version of Collada/DAE; version 1.4.1 is highly recommended as newer versions tend to severely (and irreversibly, if you're not careful) corrupt animations upon export

## Sounds and Music
- [WavePad](https://www.nch.com.au/wavepad/index.html) - for creating, editing and saving sounds for Hate is Peace
- [Audacity](https://archive.org/details/audacity-2.4.2) - for editing sounds in ways that WavePad absolutely can't
- [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/) - for creating, editing and saving music tracks for Hate is Peace
