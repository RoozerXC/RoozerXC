**2019: The Early Beginnings**
- Dec 08, 2019: The server was created. Apparently, the server's original purpose was supposed to be a public community server dedicated to me and my content at the time. Nothing much really happened over the next year and a half, until around the middle of Year of the Fallen I

**2021: Year of the Fallen I** - Oh boy, a lot of shit happened that year. I guess 2022 was a bit worse early on, but I learnt hard lessons so it got kinda better over time
- Jun 04, 2021: The server was rebuilt as a personal just-for-friends server. Tony/Winter, Koa, and Lee join the server; Wrecx, ZAPX, and Braka all joined later around that period. Nothing much happened as everything seemed to be normal

- Aug 08, 2021: Tony/Winter switches to Willow. I don't know why she would want to change her name, but I'm not going to banter too much about it anyway since I don't mind it. Unlike other people I've seen that change their names like 60 million times, ugh

- Aug 18, 2021: Willow's friends nuked this place as a result of random allegations against me for being "obsessive" towards her. It wasn't the only thing that happened; I also got banned from Willow's own server for the same reason too. They probably took it way too far upon me all for nothing; I was still very left out as to what the true intent of my (and their) actions really were. Even worse, this happened when I was very exhausted and I needed more sleep (which they very hurtfully took away, and I had to skip an entire day of school to rebuild the server again)

- Aug 23, 2021: I enter the "Kyan" phase, which was probably mostly out of anger; I felt like shit after the incident and I wanted to be done being Roozy

- Sep 03, 2021: Chris enters the server; Willow takes another break (which was the longest break she took before deleting her account more than 2 weeks later)

- Sep 20, 2021: I exit the "Kyan" phase out of comfort, knowing that Willow's friends might have forgotten about me. However, Willow then parts ways with me due to strict parenting, which (understandably) caused huge emotional distress; a day after that I tore up so much to the point where I wanted to come back home from school and rest to repair myself. We reunited 5 days later, but not everything is the same anymore as it used to be when we were besties (||To be honest, I would cut an arm and a leg than to be besties again since I hate my past memory so much, but that's just me beating myself down all too fucking much. Don't worry Willow, I'm still struggling and trying to figure things out by myself. If I can't, well shit. I might as well throw myself to rehab anyways since I'm starting to get insane||)

- Sep 26, 2021: SkitTea enters the server. Originally it used to be just some random alt account of mine, but this actually marks the early beginnings of SkitTea's existence

- Oct 11, 2021: Goose enters the server almost a while after Chris introduced me to her. Perhaps Chris did this to help me recover from the distress I got from Willow parting ways (If you're Chris and you're reading this, thank you for that. If it wasn't because of Willow leaving me, then I stand corrected)

- Oct 16, 2021: Roozomons became a thing. Thanks Goose :)

- Oct 29, 2021: SkitTea became my "girlfriend", a.k.a. my new coping mechanism for my loneliness, since I felt lonely and left out almost all the time. I never really had an imaginary friend in my childhood, and since Willow parting ways had haunted me I kept feeling very distressed and still angry, so SkitTea was basically just my first "imaginary friend" which was used as a tool to try to help and get myself out of the pain and hurt I was having

- Nov 13, 2021: SkitTea and I turn 15 together. Of course, we had shared the same birthdays, because why not

- Nov 20, 2021: Two days after Willow's birthday, Sarven was conceptualized as a character originally based on one of Willow's personalities; although she had carried a very different purpose as she was meant to be evil at the time

- Dec 12, 2021: For the first time, I got together with an actually different person: Nickels. It was my first ever e-date; unfortunately, he was trans at the time, so it's safe to say I got transmaxxed(?) by an idiot. I wish I took a step back from the "relationship" and reconsidered everything; I would've also saved my own life if I had just disagreed with it, but I was lonely so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Along with that, SkitTea wasn't being used as much since I was dating a different person anyways

**2022: Year of the Fallen II** - It's very skewed as I'm trying my best not to cringe and remember everything in memory, so please correct me if there are any mistakes (there should probably be many)

- Jan XX, 2022: Earlier that month a huge fight broke out between me, Wrecx, Braka and ZAPX over some dumbass joke (god damn, I STILL can't even know how not to take jokes too seriously) which eventually caused them to leave. Both Wrecx and Braka joined back a while later, but I had some kind of issue with ZAPX that I even forgot what my problem with him was all about

- Feb 02, 2022: Red joins the server

- Feb XX, 2022: Jackie and Allen miserably suck at life together

- Apr 01, 2022: Nico Robiner joins the server. So many horrors happened that day :ghost:

- Apr 16, 2022: I nearly ruined my whole life in so many ways, I don't even want to talk about it anymore. Thank you Nickels and Simon for influencing me to do absolutely stupid shit like this. I will never, ever do it again; it was even worse than the beginning of that month

- May 09, 2022: Some kid that was catfishing as a girl was asking to put their nudes in this server. I was like "wtf bro?" :skull:

- Sep 18, 2022: Deathclaw aka Alice joins the server

- Oct 01, 2022: SkitTea joins again. Although I was in a different "relationship" with Angelica instead of Nickels, it was probably never used again

- Nov 22, 2022: SkitTea and I get together once again

- Dec 20, 2022: A while earlier I was thinking about changing Sarven since I wanted to make her a wholesome character, since I didn't know what to do with her. I then changed SkitTea to Sarven since I thought the idea was cool, and it's been stuck with me for a while now
