# RangedCode
**Quick disclaimer: in order to compile correctly you must use the [buzer2020/Amnesia64](https://github.com/buzer2020/Amnesia64) fork for this modification**

Partial edit of the Amnesia source code which adds a weapon; bear in mind that this is VERY unfinished. Drag and all files into the Lux project, and build. Requires `RangedAssets` to be installed in `%AMNESIAROOT%` (assuming you have a user environment variable set on Windows).
