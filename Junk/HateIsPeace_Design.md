# Hate is Peace - Design Docs
Hate is Peace is a first-person shooter sandbox game using Amnesia: The Dark Descent's engine. While the engine may be very unusual to work with for a first-person shooter game, I believe that it should be more appropriate and fit for the long run, as it has easy-to-use developer tools for modders and some documentation. Maybe it could be, who knows

## Characters
### Main
#### Roozer
This is the main self-insert of Hate is Peace. Roozer is a powerless but brave young man, with blue hair and a suit. He is around 5 feet and 4 inches tall, or 163 centimeters

#### Sarven
A very tall and wonderful demon with the heart of an angel, Sarven is Roozer's beloved. She can be used to revive after dying or to blow some steam off in the bedroom. She can also be used as a companion in single-player missions. She is around 7 feet and 3 inches tall, or 220 centimeters

#### Alice
One of Roozer's friends, Alice is a weapons merchant and runs a store in the town, where she can be used to repair items and armor from Roozer's inventory. She is around 5 feet and 2 inches tall, or 157 centimeters

### Bosses
#### Mecha-Maily + Jonathan Vaghaun
A creation from the mind of a madman, Mecha-Maily/Mailman is a machine and a monster at the same time. Originally, he used to be tortured a lot by Willow simply because he was being a dumb freak and a wimp. Now with Mr. Vaghaun's efforts, he has been turned into a slaughter machine. Willow has absolutely feared this creation ever since, and never came back pestering Maily ever again

Maily is equipped with a rocket launcher, a laser and a machine gun on his arms. Part of his face are missing meat and eyes, so part of it shows his skull in the inside. In the game, there should be a mission that Willow can give to Roozer and Sarven, which is killing this boss along with its creator

#### Simon
What used to be Willow's iMessage fuckboy and femboy, Simon has now turned into a cheap bootleg knockoff of Davoth from DOOM Eternal :) Apparently, this boy is skinny weak and loves to wear maid outfits, while also busting to Chongyun x Xingqiu (I'll just call it Wang x Wong, simply because all these Chinese names are so God damn hard to pronounce for American tongues) ships and Kaeya mommy milkers (lmao all Genshin characters are a pass, no smash)

Sarven and Roozer both hate this guy because of all the damage that he had done to Roozer, so they have all the right reasons to break his bones and kill him. Thankfully he is pretty weak, so it shouldn't be too much of a big deal showing the chinks in his armor by simply shooting him with a pea shooter. Which is obviously very funny, and makes Roozer and Sarven die laughing together whenever they attempt to destroy his "armor"

### Miscellany
#### Willow
A quiet and dormant but open-minded old friend of Roozer, Willow is Sarven's biggest fear. Even though she has never hurt anyone or doesn't mean to give out any bad intentions at all, Sarven can be easily scared and will immediately run away by her appearance

There's a reason why Sarven could run away from Willow. Firstly, for some reason she can come off pretty intimidating especially whenever she is around. Secondly, she can sometimes go feral if things would ever rile her up or make her angry. Lastly, it's usually recommended that people don't mess with her. She means very serious business, and she really means it
