Greetings, my name is Roozy McRoozer, you can call me by any name you can think of in the universe whether it be Roozydoopy, doozy/doozer, boozing, kaboozer, Woozer, any that you can think of **at all**. I won't mind if you even called me Tire Iron. *Oh wait...*

I am 17 years old, currently studying C++ while also trying my hardest to take breaks and take it slow. My hobbies are fixing, repairing and building PC's and hardware, programming, gaming, music, and singing. I usually listen to deathcore, grindcore, slam, and blastbeat, as well as prog rock, heavy metal and djent.

**I'm currently taking a hiatus from making concepts and mods for Amnesia: The Dark Descent because of my involvement in a very unhealthy and toxic modding community. Hopefully I will be making a video about it discussing the things I experienced over the past couple of years and how it has significantly drained me.**

**So if you expected something from me, then I'm sorry for any long waits. Please don't hold your hopes for the things I've been trying to make. Creating mods for the game that I love so dearly to my heart takes a significant amount of time, effort, and resources especially when I'm mostly on my own with everything.**

Thank you so much for your support and understanding, and I apologize if this sounds like a pity story. Feel free to brush it off as you like, but that will never change the fact that I am tired of people who don't treat others with the utmost respect that they deserve for their bravery, hard work and excellence.
