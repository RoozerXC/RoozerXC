# *About me*
Hey, thank you for tuning into my github profile. You can call me Roozy, Roozer, Trevor or any other name; it doesn't matter. If you've been friends with me on Discord for some time, you may know me as the creator of the wholesome demoness character Sarven

I'm mostly demotivated, bored as hell and out of ideas, so if you want to suggest an idea, feel free to do so either in my [issues](https://github.com/RoozerXC/RoozerXC/issues) or [discussions](https://github.com/RoozerXC/RoozerXC/discussions) sections. Right now I am currently working on [Hate is Peace](HateIsPeace/Design.md), a small little fps sandbox game using [Amnesia: The Dark Descent's engine](https://github.com/buzer2020/Amnesia64) strictly for fun. I also plan to make it a ready-to-use/game development-friendly engine too, for those starting out on game dev

About Hate is Peace: it's going to be a very slow project though, so don't expect a release date anyway or **you'll drive me fucking crazy and I'll hate you to death**

Other than that, nice to meet you. If you want to look at my other stuff you can check out my [Neocities website](https://roozerxc.neocities.org) and my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@roozerxc)
