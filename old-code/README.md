ok so this is basically where all the junk goes

# RangedCode
this is specifically for a fork of [buzer2020/Amnesia64](https://github.com/buzer2020/Amnesia64) which adds a weapon, bear in mind that this is VERY unfinished. just make sure to drag and replace all files into the Lux project, and build. I also have RangedAssets too, since this modification requires some custom assets to work. without them, the game would probably crash lol
